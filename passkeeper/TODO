Write document about that.
Write unittest
Write functionnal tests
Implement : 
  * encrypt
  * Decrypt
  * Ensure flush history still good
  * Ensure search don't try to load this files

Blueprint :
Was able to create directory like mydata.raw
This directory can contain subdir with file in it.
When encrypt is colled each file will be encrypt with gpg.
And we keep this subdir in encripted dir.

To handle remove :
walk in raw directory.
If file need to be deleted :
  * shred the file
  * git force remove the file
It will remove also the directory if empty.

When call decrypt the directory and subdirector need to be recreated.
os.mkdirs ?



BUG:
cleanup deleted file s'en fou de l'extension. il essaye de faire Ã§a sur les dossiers
